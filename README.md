# Thoughts (answered with generative AI)

-   Why does text inside of canvas not render e.g \<canvas>Hello World\</canvas>
    -   The \<canvas>
        element is designed for drawing graphics with JavaScript, not displaying HTML content directly. To show text on a canvas, you need to use JavaScript and specific text rendering functions provided by the canvas API.
-   What is the default size of canvas
    -   The default size of a canvas element is 300 pixels wide and 150 pixels high. You can change this using HTML attributes or CSS properties.
