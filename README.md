This project is for me to practice learning the Canvas API for an upcoming job opportunity of mine.

# Getting started

Simply run the index.html file. For livereload I run it with vscode live server.

# Thoughts

-   Why does text inside of canvas not render e.g <canvas>Hello World</canvas>
-   What is the default size of canvas
